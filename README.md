It's basically a drawing party game that can go in two different ways:
 
Drawful:
At the start of the game, players draw whatever they want and then type what they want to "title" their drawing. After time is up, everyone will have the chance to "title" everyone else's drawings. After this is done, one picture will be shown with all the possible titles and players (besides the original drawer) will pick a title. Players who pick the original drawer's title wins the most points. If another player's title is chosen, that player who wrote the title will receive points. Repeat until all the pictures are shown and the winner is the one with the most points
Ex of game-play) Player A is the original drawer and his title is "Dog". Player B titles the picture "Cat". Let's say Player C selected the title ""Dog"" after the draw and naming phase is over. Player C will receive points for getting the right answer. Say Player D picked the title "Cat"; Player B will then receive points.
