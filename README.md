## Idea Numero Uno -- Draw my thing
#### ID: 160

It's basically a drawing party game that can go in two different ways:
 
Drawful:
At the start of the game, players draw whatever they want and then type what they want to "title" their drawing. After time is up, everyone will have the chance to "title" everyone else's drawings. After this is done, one picture will be shown with all the possible titles and players (besides the original drawer) will pick a title. Players who pick the original drawer's title wins the most points. If another player's title is chosen, that player who wrote the title will receive points. Repeat until all the pictures are shown and the winner is the one with the most points
Ex of game-play) Player A is the original drawer and his title is "Dog". Player B titles the picture "Cat". Let's say Player C selected the title ""Dog"" after the draw and naming phase is over. Player C will receive points for getting the right answer. Say Player D picked the title "Cat"; Player B will then receive points.

Draw My Thing Way: 
Everyone is given a random word that they have to draw a picture representing the word. After time is up, one drawing will be shown and every player would have to guess what that pictures represents (players are rewarded points if they answer correctly and by how fast they figured out the answer ). Repeat until all pictures are shown and the winner is whoever has the most points."

## Idea Numero Dos -- Get Off My Planet
#### ID: 145
A game where you colonize a planet with farms, hospitals, power plants, workshops, mines, and tower defense structures in preparation for alien attacks. The attacks come in waves and the player has to fend them off and send attack ships of their own to defeat the aliens. /// You can place towers down and there will be enemies following a path which your towers will shoot at. Killing enemies gives you money which you can use to purchase/upgrade towers.

## Idea Numero Tres -- Food OCR
#### ID: 167
An app that takes a picture of a food/ uploads a picture of a food and then cross-checks the picture with Google Images and Yelp to find where you can get that food.
